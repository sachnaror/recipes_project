## 🌶️ What's This Spicy Business?

Ever stood in your kitchen, staring at random vegetables like they're abstract art? Wondering if that lonely potato and abandoned bell pepper could become something more than just roommates in your fridge? Well, wonder no more!

This Django-powered kitchen companion is here to rescue you from the depths of culinary confusion. Simply tell it what ingredients you have, and it will magically suggest Indian dishes you can make - complete with recipes that even your grandmother would *probably* approve of.

## 🚀 Features That'll Spice Up Your Life

- **10 Ingredient Fields**: Because who doesn't love the satisfaction of filling out forms?
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Like having an Indian aunty in your computer, minus the "Why aren't you married yet?" questions
- **Bilingual Support**: Enter ingredients in English or Hindi - we don't judge
- **Real-time Results**: Faster than your pressure cooker's whistle
- **Mobile Responsive**: Use it while grocery shopping (and impress random strangers)

pip install -r requirements.txt
